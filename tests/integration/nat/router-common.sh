# Setting a router that looks like a typical home router requires a few more things:

# 1. By default, never forward anything. This prevents us from doing things like
#    forwarding packets from the public WAN into the LAN (which would completely
#    de-characterize our NAT box) by accident.
iptables -P FORWARD DROP

# 2. Traffic originating FROM the LAN subnet, however, should be allowed to flow
#    to the WAN. The "NEW" in the --ctstate is what actually allows new connections
#    to be established.
iptables -A FORWARD\
  -s "$LAN_SUBNET"\
  -o "$wanif"\
  -m conntrack --ctstate NEW,ESTABLISHED,RELATED \

# 3. For WAN-to-LAN traffic, we only allow packets that are part of an
#    established connection - this is what allows us to receive traffic from
#    the internet.
iptables -A FORWARD\
  -d "$LAN_SUBNET"\
  -i "$wanif"\

# Finally, NAT boxes silently drop all incoming traffic on the WAN interface
# by default - if we don't do this, in fact, the router will issue an RST
# (connection refused) when external peers try to connect, and things like hole
# punching will fail.
