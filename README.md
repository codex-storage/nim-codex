# Codex Decentralized Durability Engine

> The Codex project aims to create a decentralized durability engine that allows persisting data in p2p networks. In other words, it allows storing files and data with predictable durability guarantees for later retrieval.

> WARNING: This project is under active development and is considered pre-alpha.

## Build and Run

For detailed instructions on preparing to build nim-codex see [*Build Codex*](https://docs.codex.storage/learn/build).

To build the project, clone it and run:

```bash
make update && make
```

The executable will be placed under the `build` directory under the project root.

Run the client with:

```bash
build/codex
```

## Configuration

It is possible to configure a Codex node in several ways:
 1. CLI options
 2. Environment variables
 3. Configuration file

The order of priority is the same as above: CLI options --> Environment variables --> Configuration file.

Please check [documentation](https://docs.codex.storage/learn/run#configuration) for more information.

## Guides

To get acquainted with Codex, consider:
* running the simple [Codex Two-Client Test](https://docs.codex.storage/learn/local-two-client-test) for a start, and;
* if you are feeling more adventurous, try [Running a Local Codex Network with Marketplace Support](https://docs.codex.storage/learn/local-marketplace) using a local blockchain as well.

## API

The client exposes a REST API that can be used to interact with the clients. Overview of the API can be found on [api.codex.storage](https://api.codex.storage).

### Linting and formatting

`nim-codex` uses [nph](https://github.com/arnetheduck/nph) for formatting our code and it is required to adhere to its styling.
If you are setting up fresh setup, in order to get `nph` run `make build-nph`.
In order to format files run `make nph/<file/folder you want to format>`. 
If you want you can install Git pre-commit hook using `make install-nph-commit`, which will format modified files prior committing them. 
If you are using VSCode and the [NimLang](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NimLang.nimlang) extension you can enable "Format On Save" (eq. the `nim.formatOnSave` property) that will format the files using `nph`.
