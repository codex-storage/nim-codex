    # yields \build\storage-nim\... , which the Linux builder then treats as a
    # single relative filename and cannot open. The failure surfaces as
    # "cannot open file" naming a path that visibly exists.
    #
    # Note what does NOT need patching: the `currentSourcePath.rsplit({DirSep,
    # AltSep}, 1)[0] & "/..."` idiom returns an unmodified substring and is
    # already correct -- that is what nim-bearssl, nim-blscurve, nim-secp256k1,
    # nim-zlib, nim-lsquic and boringssl's own srcPath use. nim-nat-traversal
