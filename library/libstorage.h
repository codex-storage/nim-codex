/**
 * @file libstorage.h
 * @brief C-exported interface for the Storage shared library.
 *
 * This file implements the public C API for libstorage. It acts as the bridge
 * between C programs and the internal Nim implementation.
 *
 * Unless it is explicitly stated otherwise, all functions are asynchronous and execute
 * their work on a separate thread, returning results via the provided callback. The
 * result code of the function represents the synchronous status of the call itself:
 * returning `RET_OK` if the job has been dispatched to the thread, and `RET_ERR` in case
 * of immediate failure.
 *
 * The callback function is invoked with the result of the operation, including
 * any data or error messages. If the call was successful, `callerRet` will be `RET_OK`,
 * and `msg` will contain the result data. If there was an error, `callerRet` will be `RET_ERR`,
 * and `msg` will contain the error message.
 *
 * When a function supports progress updates, it may invoke the callback multiple times:
 * first with `RET_PROGRESS` and progress information, and finally with `RET_OK` or `RET_ERR`
 * upon completion. The `msg` parameter will contain a chunk of data for upload and
 * download operations.
 *
 * `userData` is a pointer provided by the caller that is passed back to the callback
 * for context.
